	<h1>The International 2021</h1>
	<a href="fancifymytext.html">FancifyMyText</a>
    <p>The International 2021, also known as The International 10 (TI10), was the tenth iteration of The International, an annual Dota 2 world championship esports tournament. </p>
	<p><strong>Hosted by <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/">Valve</a>,</strong> the game's developer, the tournament followed a year-long series of tournaments awarding qualifying points, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), with the </p>
	<p>top 12 ranking teams being directly invited to the tournament. In addition, six more teams earned invites through regional qualifiers held earlier in 2021. The tournament </p>
	<p>took place in Bucharest, Romania, with the main event held behind closed doors at the Arena Națională due to restrictions on gatherings in the city.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As with every International from 2013 onwards, the prize pool was crowdfunded by the Dota 2 community via its battle pass feature with the total reaching <strong>US$40 million, </strong> </p>
	<p>making it <strong>the largest esports prize pool in history.</strong> The event was also the first International held since 2019, as the 2020 iteration was cancelled due to the COVID-19 </p>
	<p>pandemic. The Grand Finals were held between PSG.LGD and Team Spirit, with the latter winning 3–2 in a best-of-five series.</p>
